//* 1) Add the job parameters to meet your system requirements.       *         
//*                                                                   *         
//* 2) Provide, in variable SVRPATH, the home directory of the        *         
//*    product install (default is /usr/lpp/IBM/debug).               *

//* 3) Provide, in variable CFGDIR, the home directory for the        *         
//*    customized configuration files (default is /etc/debug).        *

//* 2. When using existing directories, for example /etc, note that   *         
//*    these directories are expected to have at least a permission   *         
//*    bit mask that allows read/execute for everyone (eg. mask 755). *
